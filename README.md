# StarCraft Player Ranking Conclusion

## 1. Executive Summary
We analyzed player behavior in Starcraft to predict player ranks using performance data. Our best model achieved ~47-50% accuracy, meaning we can predict ranks with moderate confidence. The findings reveal that reaction speed, actions per minute (APM), and hotkey usage are the most important factors for higher ranks.

**Why This Matters:**
1. Game Developers: Improve matchmaking by incorporating skill-based performance metrics.
2. Players: Understand key skills that contribute to ranking up.
3. Coaches & Analysts: Can use data-driven insights to refine training programs, select/evaluate players for teams.

## 2. Key Insights from the Analysis
### What Factors Determine Player Rank?
**The model identified the top factors that separate high-ranking from low-ranking players:**
1. Reaction Speed (Action Latency) - Faster responses lead to better performance.
2. Actions Per Minute (APM) - Players who execute more actions per minute tend to achieve higher ranks.
3. Hotkey Usage - Effective hotkey management improves strategic control.
4. Game Experience (Total Hours Played) - More experienced players tend to perform better.
5. Consistency in Play Actions - Maintaining a steady pattern of actions contributes to ranking up.


## Model Performance Summary

| Model Variant | Accuracy | Key Observations |
|:----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Logistic Regression | ~41.7% | Struggles with mid-level ranks, better for higher ranks. |
| Random Forest (Default) | ~44.9% | Performs better than Logistic Regression but misses some ranks. |
| Random Forest (Balanced Data) | ~39.8% | Improved recall for underrepresented ranks but lower overall accuracy. |
| Random Forest (Feature Selection) | ~41.2% | Better rank balance, slight accuracy drop. |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | 47-50% | Best-performing model with improved generalization. |

## 3. Key Takeaways for Stakeholders
### For Game Developers
Improve matchmaking by incorporating key skill-based metrics into ranking algorithms. Consider rewarding players who demonstrate strong reaction speed and strategic control.

### For Players
Prioritize improving APM, reaction time, and hotkey efficiency to climb ranks. Experience matters, but strategic play is more important than total hours played.


**Based on these findings, players looking to improve their rank should focus on:**
1. Increasing APM: Train with practice drills to improve the speed of actions.
2. Exploring the Map More: Make scouting a habit to gain strategic advantages.
3. Using the Minimap Effectively: Learn to attack and issue commands via the minimap.
4. Mastering Hotkeys: Assign critical commands to hotkeys for faster execution.
5. Reducing Action Latency: Practice fluid gameplay to minimize delays between actions.

## 4. Next Steps & Improvements
1. Model Improvement techniques: recursive feature elimination, k-fold cross validation and hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV
2. Testing advanced Machine Learning Models (XGBoost, Neural Networks) to enhance accuracy.
